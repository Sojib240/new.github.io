                        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in
                        our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
                        high priority for the management of the Company Name.
                        The use of the Internet pages of the Company Name is
                        possible without any indication of personal data;
                        however, if a data subject wants to use special
                        enterprise services via our website, processing of
                        personal data could become necessary. If the processing
                        of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory
                        basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent
                        from the data subject.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The processing of personal data, such as the name,
                        address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
                        subject shall always be in line with the General Data
                        Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
                        country-specific data protection regulations applicable
                        to the Company Name. By means of this data protection
                        declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the
                        general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the
                        personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore,
                        data subjects are informed, by means of this data
                        protection declaration, of the rights to which they are
                        entitled.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As the controller, the Company Name has implemented
                        numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure
                        the most complete protection of personal data processed
                        through this website. However, Internet-based data
                        transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so
                        absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
                        reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal
                        data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

                    <h1>1. Definitions</h1>
                    <p>
                        The data protection declaration of the Company Name is

                        the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation
                        (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be
                        legible and understandable for the general public, as
                        well as our customers and business partners. To ensure

                        without the use of additional information, provided that
                        such additional information is kept separately and is
                        subject to technical and organisational measures to
                        ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an
                        identified or identifiable natural person.

                        Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many
                        cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a
                        unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a
                        character string through which Internet pages and
                        servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
                        in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited
                        Internet sites and servers to differentiate the
                        individual browser of the dats subject from other
                        Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific

                        allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our

                        website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to
                        enter access data each time the website is accessed,
                        because this is taken over by the website, and the
                        cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system.
                        Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an
                        online shop. The online store remembers the articles

                        The website of the Company Name collects a series of

                    <h1>5. Registration on our website</h1>
                    <p>
                        The data subject has the possibility to register on the
                        website of the controller with the indication of
                        personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to
                        the controller is determined by the respective input
                        mask used for the registration. The personal data
                        entered by the data subject are collected and stored
                        exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for
                        his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to
                        one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also
                        uses personal data for an internal purpose which is
                        attributable to the controller.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        By registering on the website of the controller, the IP
                        address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP)
                        and used by the data subject—date, and time of the
                        registration are also stored. The storage of this data
                        takes place against the background that this is the only
                        way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if
                        necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed
                        offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary
                        to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to
                        third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to
                        pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of
                        criminal prosecution.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary
                        indication of personal data, is intended to enable the
                        controller to offer the data subject contents or
                        services that may only be offered to registered users
                        due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered
                        persons are free to change the personal data specified
                        during the registration at any time, or to have them
                        completely deleted from the data stock of the
                        controller.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The data controller shall, at any time, provide
                        information upon request to each data subject as to what
                        personal data are stored about the data subject. In
                        addition, the data controller shall correct or erase
                        personal data at the request or indication of the data
                        subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage
                        obligations. The entirety of the controller’s employees
                        are available to the data subject in this respect as
                        contact persons.

                        6. Subscription to our newsletters On the website of the
                        Company Name, users are given the opportunity to
                        subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask
                        used for this purpose determines what personal data are
                        transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered
                        from the controller.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Company Name informs its customers and business partners
                        regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise
                        offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received
                        by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid
                        e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for
                        the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be
                        sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject
                        for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal
                        reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This
                        confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner
                        of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized
                        to receive the newsletter.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        During the registration for the newsletter, we also
                        store the IP address of the computer system assigned by
                        the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data
                        subject at the time of the registration, as well as the
                        date and time of the registration. The collection of
                        this data is necessary in order to understand the
                        (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data
                        subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim
                        of the legal protection of the controller.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The personal data collected as part of a registration
                        for the newsletter will only be used to send our
                        newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter
                        may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary
                        for the operation of the newsletter service or a
                        registration in question, as this could be the case in
                        the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or
                        in the event of a change in technical circumstances.
                        There will be no transfer of personal data collected by
                        the newsletter service to third parties. The
                        subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the
                        data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of
                        personal data, which the data subject has given for
                        shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For
                        the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding
                        link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to
                        unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on
                        the website of the controller, or to communicate this to
                        the controller in a different way.

                    <h1>7. Newsletter-Tracking</h1>
                    <p>
                        The newsletter of the Company Name contains so-called
                        tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic
                        embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format
                        to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a
                        statistical analysis of the success or failure of online
                        marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking
                        pixel, the Company Name may see if and when an e-mail
                        was opened by a data subject, and which links in the
                        e-mail were called up by data subjects.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels
                        contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by
                        the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the
                        newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future
                        newsletters even better to the interests of the data
                        subject. These personal data will not be passed on to
                        third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to
                        revoke the respective separate declaration of consent
                        issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a
                        revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the
                        controller. The Company Name automatically regards a
                        withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a
                        revocation.

                        have incomplete personal data completed, including by
                        means of providing a supplementary statement.<br />

                        d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) Each data
                        subject shall have the right granted by the European
                        legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of
                        personal data concerning him or her without undue delay,
                        and the controller shall have the obligation to erase
                        personal data without undue delay where one of the
                        following grounds applies, as long as the processing is
                        not necessary: The personal data are no longer necessary
                        in relation to the purposes for which they were
                        collected or otherwise processed. The data subject
                        withdraws consent to which the processing is based
                        according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or
                        point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there
                        is no other legal ground for the processing.<br />
                        The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to
                        Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding
                        legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data
                        subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article
                        21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been
                        unlawfully processed.<br />
                        The personal data must be erased for compliance with a
                        legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which
                        the controller is subject.<br />
                        The personal data have been collected in relation to the
                        offer of information society services referred to in
                        Article 8(1) of the GDPR.<br />
                        If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data
                        subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data
                        stored by the Company Name, he or she may, at any time,
                        contact any employee of the controller. An employee of
                        Company Name shall promptly ensure that the erasure
                        request is complied with immediately.<br />
                        Where the controller has made personal data public and
                        is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the
                        personal data, the controller, taking account of
                        available technology and the cost of implementation,
                        shall take reasonable steps, including technical
                        measures, to inform other controllers processing the
                        personal data that the data subject has requested
                        erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or
                        replication of, those personal data, as far as
                        processing is not required. An employees of the Company
                        Name will arrange the necessary measures in individual
                        cases.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        e) Right of restriction of processing Each data subject
                        shall have the right granted by the European legislator
                        to obtain from the controller restriction of processing
                        where one of the following applies:<br />
                        The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the
                        data subject, for a period enabling the controller to
                        verify the accuracy of the personal data.<br />
                        The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes
                        the erasure of the personal data and requests instead
                        the restriction of their use instead.<br />
                        The controller no longer needs the personal data for the
                        purposes of the processing, but they are required by the
                        data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence
                        of legal claims.<br />
                        The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to
                        Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification
                        whether the legitimate grounds of the controller
                        override those of the data subject.<br />
                        If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a
                        data subject wishes to request the restriction of the
                        processing of personal data stored by the Company Name,
                        he or she may at any time contact any employee of the
                        controller. The employee of the Company Name will
                        arrange the restriction of the processing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        f) Right to data portability Each data subject shall
                        have the right granted by the European legislator, to
                        receive the personal data concerning him or her, which
                        was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly
                        used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have
                        the right to transmit those data to another controller
                        without hindrance from the controller to which the
                        personal data have been provided, as long as the
                        processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of
                        Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of
                        the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of
                        Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried
                        out by automated means, as long as the processing is not
                        necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
                        the public interest or in the exercise of official
                        authority vested in the controller.<br />
                        Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data
                        portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the
                        data subject shall have the right to have personal data
                        transmitted directly from one controller to another,
                        where technically feasible and when doing so does not
                        adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.<br />
                        In order to assert the right to data portability, the
                        data subject may at any time contact any employee of the
                        Company Name.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        g) Right to object Each data subject shall have the
                        right granted by the European legislator to object, on
                        grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at
                        any time, to processing of personal data concerning him
                        or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article
                        6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based
                        on these provisions.<br />
                        The Company Name shall no longer process the personal
                        data in the event of the objection, unless we can
                        demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
                        processing which override the interests, rights and
                        freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment,
                        exercise or defence of legal claims.<br />
                        If the Company Name processes personal data for direct
                        marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the
                        right to object at any time to processing of personal
                        data concerning him or her for such marketing. This
                        applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to
                        such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to
                        the Company Name to the processing for direct marketing
                        purposes, the Company Name will no longer process the
                        personal data for these purposes.<br />
                        In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds
                        relating to his or her particular situation, to object
                        to processing of personal data concerning him or her by
                        the Company Name for scientific or historical research
                        purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to
                        Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is
                        necessary for the performance of a task carried out for
                        reasons of public interest.<br />
                        In order to exercise the right to object, the data
                        subject may contact any employee of the Company Name. In
                        addition, the data subject is free in the context of the
                        use of information society services, and notwithstanding
                        Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object
                        by automated means using technical specifications.

                        h) Automated individual decision-making, including
                        profiling Each data subject shall have the right granted
                        by the European legislator not to be subject to a
                        decision based solely on automated processing, including
                        profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him
                        or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her,
                        as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for
                        entering into, or the performance of, a contract between
                        the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not
                        authorised by Union or Member State law to which the
                        controller is subject and which also lays down suitable
                        measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and
                        freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based
                        on the data subject’s explicit consent.<br />
                        If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or
                        the performance of, a contract between the data subject
                        and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data
                        subject’s explicit consent, the Company Name shall
                        implement suitable measures to safeguard the data
                        subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests,
                        at least the right to obtain human intervention on the
                        part of the controller, to express his or her point of
                        view and contest the decision. If the data subject
                        wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated
                        individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time,
                        contact any employee of the Company Name.

                        <br />
                        i) Right to withdraw data protection consent Each data
                        subject shall have the right granted by the European
                        legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing
                        of his or her personal data at any time. If the data
                        subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the
                        consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any
                        employee of the Company Name.

                    <h1>11. Legal basis for the processing</h1>
                    <p>
                        Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for
                        processing operations for which we obtain consent for a
                        specific processing purpose. If the processing of
                        personal data is necessary for the performance of a
                        contract to which the data subject is party, as is the
                        case, for example, when processing operations are
                        necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any
                        other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1)
                        lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
                        operations which are necessary for carrying out
                        pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of
                        inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our
                        company subject to a legal obligation by which
                        processing of personal data is required, such as for the
                        fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based
                        on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing
                        of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital
                        interests of the data subject or of another natural
                        person. This would be the case, for example, if a
                        visitor were injured in our company and his name, age,
                        health insurance data or other vital information would
                        have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
                        third party. Then the processing would be based on Art.
                        6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could
                        be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis
                        is used for processing operations which are not covered
                        by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if
                        processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                        legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a
                        third party, except where such interests are overridden
                        by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of
                        the data subject which require protection of personal
                        data. Such processing operations are particularly
                        permissible because they have been specifically
                        mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that
                        a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data
                        subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47
                        Sentence 2 GDPR).

                        The criteria used to determine the period of storage of
                        personal data is the respective statutory retention
                        period. After expiration of that period, the
                        corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it
                        is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the
                        contract or the initiation of a contract.

                        into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to
                        provide the personal data; possible consequences of
                        failure to provide such data

                    <p>
                        We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly
                        required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also
                        result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on
                        the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary
                        to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us
                        with personal data, which must subsequently be processed
                        by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
                        provide us with personal data when our company signs a
                        contract with him or her. The non-provision of the
                        personal data would have the consequence that the
                        contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
                        Before personal data is provided by the data subject,
                        the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
                        clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of
                        the personal data is required by law or contract or is
                        necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
                        there is an obligation to provide the personal data and
                        the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
